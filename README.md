# Data to Decision, Modeling and Deployment
### Welcome to my BUS 548 Final Project!

In this assignment, I was tasked with cleaning the data, creating multiple models for prediction data science salaries, and creating a user interface that would allow users to enter their information and recieve an expected salary. The chosen model is a small decision tree trained on 63 features.

**Thank you for visiting my page! Below is an image of how the user interface will look if you follow along.**
