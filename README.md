# Data to Decision, Modeling and Deployment
## Welcome to my BUS 548 Final Project!

In this assignment, I was tasked with cleaning the data, creating multiple models for prediction data science salaries, and creating a user interface that would allow users to enter their information and recieve an expected salary. The chosen model is a small decision tree trained on 63 features.
